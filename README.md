# computer-vision-based-autonomous-vehicle
We have come across many specially abled people who need someone with them always for their mobility from one place to other.To help them become independent and to enable them move to wherever location they want, we have to design our vehicles in a special way.  We are specially concerned about the following disability :-  Lost any arm or leg. 2)Paralyzed person. The problem is to design or determine a way in which these category person can drive a car or how can he control the car like a normal human being do,this will enable their mobility from one place to another without being dependent on any one. We will be implementing a motion detector, using computer vision knowledge and will detect the motion of any body part of the specially abled person.  According to the motion of the body part, we are going to control the car.There will be certain sets of instruction, like, for example if the person turn his head towards right the car will turn right.  There may also be some chances in which this person will arbitrarily move his parts, we have to also detect such kind of issue using computer vision and programming techniques.
